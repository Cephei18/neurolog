# NeuroLog

An on-chain emotional check-in and self-commitment journal.

Built during a hackathon on 24th December (12:00–4:00 PM IST).

## Idea
NeuroLog treats emotions and personal commitments as first-class data.
Users check in emotionally, commit to a small intention, and optionally stake
testnet ETH to reinforce consistency — without exposing private thoughts on-chain.

## Status
🚧 Hackathon MVP in progress
